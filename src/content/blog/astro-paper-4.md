Introduction to Sora
On February 16, 2024, OpenAI released Sora, a large-scale model tool for "text-to-video," which generates videos using natural language descriptions. This announcement once again astonished the global social media platforms and the entire world. The bar for AI videos was instantly raised by Sora. While tools like Runway Pika are still breaking through the coherence within a few seconds, Sora can already directly generate seamless "one-shot" videos lasting up to 60 seconds. It's worth noting that Sora has not been officially released yet but is already capable of achieving this level of effectiveness.

The name "Sora" comes from the Japanese word "ç©º" (, sora), meaning "sky," to symbolize its boundless creative potential.
