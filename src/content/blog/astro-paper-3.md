These days, with Sora's popularity on the rise, courses and tutorials related to it have also gained traction. However, here, I want to offer a few words of advice:

Sora has not been officially released by OpenAI yet. Currently, it's still in the testing phase, let alone the public beta. So, if someone claims to offer you access to a public beta, you should be cautious.

Only a handful of people have been granted permission to use Sora at the moment. Apart from the internal staff at OpenAI and a few influential individuals, access to Sora has not been extended to the public.

Since there hasn't been a public beta yet, there's no opportunity to learn the usage techniques and gain experience. If you haven't used it, where would you get the experience from?

Therefore, I advise you not to rush into things. Don't get caught up in the moment and end up being taken advantage of. When it's time to learn, I'll let you know.

On the journey of learning and using AI, we must not lose sight of ourselves. No matter how great the tool is, it ultimately depends on the user. My suggestion is to strengthen your knowledge base.

With a solid foundation and the powerful assistance of AI, you can improve efficiency rapidly. Remember: tools are aids, but it's the users who make the difference.
