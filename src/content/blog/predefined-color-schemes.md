 Sora Emerges, China Will Accelerate its Catch-Up Pace
---

According to the website of Singapore's "Straits Times" on February 20th, following the emergence of ChatGPT, a generative artificial intelligence (AI) developed by OpenAI, the United States' OpenAI has once again made headlines with its lifelike video generation technology. While professionals in the film and television industry worry that this technology might lead to their unemployment, the urgency of the technological competition between China and the United States is also escalating.

With just inputting content, prompts, or images, the video generation model Sora developed by OpenAI can quickly produce high-fidelity videos lasting up to one minute. For Sora, the complex video production process of the past is just a matter of a sentence.

Sora's emergence has sparked discussions in China's internet and technology circles. Some netizens excitedly say that future short video production may not need humans anymore. Others lament that Sora's realism is almost of epic proportions, and technological progress is just too fast, almost frighteningly so.

This has also brought about a certain "AI anxiety." This anxiety stems from concerns among the public and technology professionals that Sora might widen the AI gap between China and the United States.

However, on February 20th, Zhou Chengxiong, an expert from the Institute of Science and Technology Strategy Consultation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, wrote that although major breakthroughs in AI technology are almost always pioneered by American companies, latecomers also have significant advantages, namely, significantly reduced risks and uncertainties in the process of advancement. China has every opportunity to lead the world in the application of AI technology in the future.

A blogger pointed out that the emergence of Sora has paved the way for China's AI field, helping various sectors integrate resources and invest in research and development more quickly, thereby narrowing the gap between China and the United States in the field of video generation. It is inevitable for China to produce such products, and it is impossible to miss out on this wave or fall completely behind. "The release of Sora will further narrow the gap between China and the United States in AI."

According to a report by the American website "The New York Times" on February 21st, by the end of 2023, a Chinese startup had jumped to the top of a ranking assessing the capabilities of open-source AI systems.

The company is backed by well-funded investors, with a valuation of approximately $1 billion. However, there is a variable: some of its technology is derived from Meta's LLaMA model.

As Chinese companies strive to catch up, Washington finds itself in an awkward position. The United States is trying to slow down China's progress by restricting chip sales and related investments, but it has not yet banned the practice of promoting the use of open-source software.

The founder of the aforementioned startup said in an email statement that their AI model is based on the LLaMA model because using open-source technology is standard practice. The company uses its own data and algorithms to train the AI model from scratch, and data and algorithms are the primary determinants of its model's outstanding performance.

China has long listed artificial intelligence as a key development area, providing support to researchers and companies in this field. Today, companies such as Baidu, Alibaba, dairy company Mengniu, and educational group TAL have joined domestic AI competitions, with the media describing this trend as the "battle of a hundred models." Despite setbacks, a few companies like Baidu have started from scratch to build basic models.

In the field of artificial intelligence, Chinese companies have shown some highlights, such as computer vision and autonomous driving cars. Some Chinese entrepreneurs hope to make breakthroughs in other generative artificial intelligence fields, surpassing the United States.

Last year, Wang Changhu, who had worked at ByteDance, founded AiShi Technology Co., Ltd. in Beijing to explore what he believes to be the next frontier of artificial intelligence: video generation. The company has released the video generation tool PixVerse, which helps users create videos through textual descriptions.

He said, "As pioneers in the field of video generation, this gives us a great advantage."
