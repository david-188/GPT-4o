In January 2024, OpenAI released Sora, a text-to-video tool, which amazed the tech world with its stunning video quality. Dubbed by a prominent tech figure as "once unbelievable, now seemingly unreal," Sora's introduction sparked widespread discussion. What is Sora? How does it differ from previous AI tools? What impact does it have on societal development? These questions have ignited public debate. (This article is not AI-generated; this disclaimer is hereby made.)

What is Sora? What are its characteristics?
In recent years, the development in AI and large-scale models has been rapid and continuous. From speech-to-text conversion to interactive text tools like ChatGPT3 and ChatGPT4, to AI image generation tools like Midjourney, and now to Sora, a text-to-video tool. What sets Sora apart is not just its ability to generate videos from text but also the way it is trained through a programmatic approach. Previously, creating a 3D video required meticulous modeling and rendering, with each frame meticulously crafted. Additionally, what's remarkable about Sora is its adherence to real-world physics in generating virtual videos. Many tech enthusiasts believe that Sora is building a "world model," striving to virtualize and replicate the real world. The name "Sora" means "endless" in Japanese, prompting reflection on why OpenAI chose this name.

How will Sora's emergence impact current industries?
Currently, the impact on all image-related industries is quite apparent. Adobe's stock price fell by 7.41% following Sora's release. Some analysts predict significant disruption in several sectors. Firstly, the film and television industry, where AI could potentially handle everything from set design to animation. Secondly, the advertising industry, where AI-generated content could revolutionize campaign creation. Thirdly, the short video industry, where Sora's ability to generate 60-second videos with a single command could challenge content creators. Fourthly, higher education, where traditional programs like film production may face obsolescence with AI advancements.

Are we prepared for AI's development?
The concept and algorithm behind Sora were initially proposed by Google but faced challenges in implementation. Innovation in AI development is constrained by factors like capital and ecosystem. China's AI development faces challenges such as model creation, computing power, data quality, and investor patience. As AI becomes a driving force in society, it will absorb significant resources, akin to the industrial revolution. The emergence of AI may disrupt existing social structures and management systems, leading to new challenges and opportunities. As AI algorithms improve and data grows exponentially, societal impacts will continue to evolve. Planning ahead for AI ethics, compliance, and legal frameworks is imperative.
